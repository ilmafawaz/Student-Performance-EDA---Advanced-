# Student-Performance-EDA-Advanced-
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student academic performance dataset to understand how demographic, socio-economic, and preparation-related factors influence student outcomes. The analysis combines data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate exploration, followed by a dashboard for clear, non-technical storytelling.

Dataset
Students Performance Dataset (students_performance.csv)
The dataset includes information such as:
Gender
Race / Ethnicity
Parental level of education
Lunch type
Test preparation course completion
Math score
Reading score
Writing score

Project Objectives
Prepare and clean raw educational data
Explore individual variable distributions
Analyse relationships between demographic factors and academic performance
Identify patterns that influence total student scores
Present insights in an intuitive dashboard suitable for non-technical audiences

Data Cleaning
Key data preparation steps include:
Renaming columns for clarity and consistency
Verifying missing values and duplicates
Ensuring correct data types for numerical and categorical variables
Creating a Total Score feature by combining subject scores
All cleaning steps are documented in the notebook.

Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis was used to understand individual variables, including:
Distribution of math, reading, and writing scores
Total score distribution
Student counts by gender, lunch type, and test preparation status
These analyses help identify overall performance trends and score distributions.

Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis examined relationships such as:
Gender vs Total Score
Lunch type vs Total Score
Test preparation vs Total Score
Parental education vs Total Score
This step highlights how different background factors are associated with academic performance.

Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis was performed by grouping multiple factors together to:
Compare average total scores across gender, lunch type, and test preparation
Identify combinations of factors linked to higher or lower performance
This provides deeper insight beyond single-variable relationships.

 Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard is included to summarise key findings visually:
Score distributions
Performance comparisons across demographic groups
High-level insights for quick understanding
The dashboard is available as a PDF in the dashboard/ folder.

Key Insights
Students who completed the test preparation course generally perform better
Standard lunch students show higher average scores compared to free/reduced lunch
Female students slightly outperform male students in total score on average
Parental education level shows a positive association with student performance

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how non-academic factors such as preparation, family background, and support systems influence student performance.
The findings can support educators, policymakers, and institutions in identifying areas where targeted interventions may improve learning outcomes.
